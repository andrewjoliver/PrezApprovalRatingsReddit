8. Download the Facebook data in CSV form here: https://data.world/martinchek/2012-2016-facebook-posts. Name each file with the news source and put it in a subdirectory with the same name (i.e. abc/abc.csv, fox/fox.csv, etc.)

====== ANALYZING FILE SYSTEM ====== 

--- reddit-analyzer.py ----

This piece of code iterates over our reddit data sets and generates the map X as defined in our project document for each subreddit.

1. In line 70 and 71, replace the strings file_loc_main and write_loc_main with the relevant file path for the directory containing the raw reddit data from above. 
2. In line 79, replace the directories with your relevant subdirectories (i.e. reddit/obama-democrats representing the dataset for r/democrats).
3. Run the code. It will produce output files and these will be titled output.csv.
4. Uncomment lines 93-102.
5. Comment out line 91.
6. Run the code.
7. This will produce output files. They will be titled monthly-results.csv.
